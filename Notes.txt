Objectives
- Describe cloud concepts
- Describe Azure architecture and services (Compute, Network and Storage)
- Describe Azure management and governance (Infra mgmt, Database, and software mgmt)

Structure of Course
Describe Cloud computing (25-305)
1. define cloud computing => It is someone else computer, Ability to rent computing resources on demand, windows/Linux servers, 
unlimited file storage, databases, message queues, content delivery network, batch processing jobs

Describe the shared responsibility model
1. Responsibilities between the customer and Microsoft are shared along with security
On-premises responsibility/Cloud VM responsibility

2. Define cloud models, including public/private/hybrid
public - computing services are provided by third-party providers and available on the Internet to everyone
private - computing services offered either over the internet or network to select users instead of the general public
hybrid - It is a computing environment that combines a private cloud with a public cloud

3. Compare cloud pricing models
Complexity/drawback (Unable to predict) - Cloud pricing can be complicated and is based on a few factors like Geographical region, Instance size, Bandwidth, Savings Plan,
OS SKU/License, DiskType/Size, Backup storage, support agreement, API choice, consumed storage

Benefits of using cloud services
1. Hight Availability - Ability to remain operational to users during planned or unplanned outages
2. Scalability - Ability of a system to accommodate increasing demand by adding or removing resources as needed. Vertical scaling is scaling up or down by adding resources to a single server.
Azure - 96 vCPUs/384 GB memory. Horizontal scaling is scaling in or out. It adds more servers to systems and has no limit to scaling. Adds cost as adding no. of servers to the system. 
3. Elasticity - Ability of a system to quickly and easily scale up or down the amount of resources that a system uses. Auto-scaling
4. Reliability - Ability of a system to perform its intended function without interruption and with a high degree of accuracy
5. Predictability - Ability to forecast and control the performance and behavior of a system. Includes the ability to predict system usage. 
Achieved by autoscaling, load balancing, different instance types/sizes/pricing tiers, cost management tools, API
6. Security - 
7. Governance - How your organization does business. Process of defining/implementing and monitoring a framework of policies that guides an organization's cloud operations. 
Ensures policies are followed in the cloud. Azure Policy and Blueprint
8. Manageability - Managing cloud resources and infra on the cloud. This can be achieved by CLI, PowerShell, REST, APIs, etc

Describe cloud service types
1. IaaS => Cloud providers only provide the infrastructure. Just computer, storage, and networking. Example, Virtual Machines, IaaS storage - Azure storage, IaaS Networking - VM
2. PaaS => Provides more than just the infrastructure. Includes a service layer on top of IaaS - computing, storage, and networking. Example - Azure App services, CI/CD, containers, Azure SQL Database
3. SaaS => Cloud apps - everything is managed and provided by infra so the user just needs to use those apps/services. For example, Tools such as Office 365, OneDrive, Skype

Serverless
1. Enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infra. Serverless services : Functions, Container Apps, Kubernetes, SQL Database, Cosmos DB

Virtual Machines - 723 VM
