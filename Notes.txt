Structure of Course
Describe Cloud computing (25-305)
1. define cloud computing => It is someone else computer, Ability to rent computing resources on demand, windows/Linux servers,

hybrid - It is a computing environment that combines a private cloud with a public cloud

3. Compare cloud pricing models
Complexity/drawback (Unable to predict) - Cloud pricing can be complicated and is based on a few factors like Geographical region, Instance size, Bandwidth, Savings Plan,
OS SKU/License, DiskType/Size, Backup storage, support agreement, API choice, consumed storage

Benefits of using cloud services
